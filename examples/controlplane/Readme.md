Different control plane architectures with arbitrary network topologies can be simulated using QuantumSavory. The `setup.jl` contains basic functionality required by the simulations. The other files are described below:

1a. A simulation that generates an interactive visualization for a connectionless, distributed and decentralized entanglement distribution network

1b. An interactive web app with the same simulation as 1a

2a. A simulation that generates an interactive visualization for a connection-oriented, non-distributed and centralized entanglement distribution network

2b. An interactive web app with the same simulation as 2a

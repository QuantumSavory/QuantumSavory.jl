This examples shows how you can perform GHZ projective measurements, as shown in [Utilizing probabilistic entanglement between sensors in quantum networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15652). The hub starts with $S$ entangled Bell pairs shared with $S$ remote sensors. It then performs a GHZ projection locally on its $S$ qubits by applying CNOTs and a Hadamard, followed by measurement in the computational basis. Based on the measurement outcomes, it sends classical correction tags (X or Z) to the sensors so they can apply Pauli corrections and share a proper $S$-qubit GHZ state.

This examples shows how you can perform GHZ projective measurements, as shown in [Utilizing probabilistic entanglement between sensors in quantum networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15652). A central hub is connected to S sensors. The goal is to prepare the sensors in the GHZ state by applying gates and performing measurements on the hub, then sending classical corrections to each sensor based on the measurement outcomes.

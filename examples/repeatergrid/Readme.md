This example visualizes a quantum network attempting to distribute between the Alice and Bob user pair located on the diagonal of a grid topology where asynchronous messaging and queries are used for classical communication of entanglement information between modes using protocols like [`EntanglementTracker`](@ref) and [`SwapperProt`](@ref). Link-level-entanglement is generated between all the horizontal and vertical neighbors using an entanglement generation protocol called [`EntanglerProt`](@ref). As an entanglement link is established between the end users, it is consumed by a protocol named [`EntanglementConsumer`](@ref) which records the fidelity and time of consumption of the pair. Also, the qubits that remain unused beyond their `retention_time` are discarded by the [`CutoffProt`](@ref) This module provides two ways of running the simulation using:

- [`SwapperProt`](@ref) and [`CutoffProt`](@ref) in an asynchrnous manner where they run independently and all the classical information about the quantum states is reconciled using asynchronous messages sent to the tracker.

- [`SwapperProt`](@ref) does not use qubits that are to be thrown away by the [`CutoffProt`](@ref) by checking their `agelimit` parameter passed to it during initializaton. Here, there are no outgoing messages from the [`CutoffProt`](@ref) and everything is handled by being synchronous.

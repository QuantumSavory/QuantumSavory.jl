# [Visualizations](@id Visualizations)

```@meta
DocTestSetup = quote
    using QuantumSavory
end
```

We provide many visualization tools build on top of the [Makie.jl](https://docs.makie.org/stable/) framework for interactive visualizations.

The plotting functions generally return a tuple of (subfigure, axis, plot, observable).
The observable can be used to issue a `notify` call that updates the plot with the current state of the network without replotting from scratch.
This is particularly useful for live simulation visualizations.

## The quantum registers in the network

The [`registernetplot_axis`](@ref) function can be used to draw a given set of registers, together with the quantum states they contain. It also provides interactive tools for inspecting the content of the registers (by hovering or clicking on the corresponding register slot). Here we give an example where we define a network and then plot it:

```@example vis
using GLMakie
using QuantumSavory

# create a network of qubit registers
net = RegisterNet([Register(2),Register(3),Register(2),Register(5)])

# add some states, entangle a few slots, perform some gates
initialize!(net[1,1])
initialize!(net[2,3], X₁)
initialize!((net[3,1],net[4,2]), X₁⊗Z₂)
apply!((net[2,3],net[3,1]), CNOT)

# create the plot
fig = Figure(size=(800,400))
_, ax, plt, obs = registernetplot_axis(fig[1,1],net)
fig
```

The tall rectangles are registers, the gray squares are the slots of these registers, and the (connected) black diamonds denote when a slot is occupied by some subsystem (of a potentially larger) quantum state.

The visualization is capable of showing tooltips when hovering over different components of the plot, particularly valuable for debugging. Quantum observables can be directly calculated and plotted as well (through the `observables` keyword).

Other configuration options are available as well (the ones ending on `plot` let you access the subplot objects used to create the visualization and the ones ending on `backref` provide convenient inverse mapping from graphical elements to the registers or states being visualized):

```@example vis
propertynames(plt)
```

## State and tag metadata in interactive visualizations

When working with interactive plots, you can also hover over different parts of the visualization to see the registers, what is stored in them, and potentially whether they contain any [tagged metadata in use by simulated networking protocols](@ref tagging-and-querying).

Here is what the data panels look like. (`showmetada` is used to force-show the panel, but when working interactively you simply need to hover with the cursor)

```@example vis
network = RegisterNet([Register(2),Register(3),Register(2),Register(5)]) # hide
initialize!(network[1,1]) # hide
initialize!(network[2,3], X₁) # hide
initialize!((network[3,1],network[4,2]), X₁⊗Z₂) # hide
apply!((network[2,3],network[3,1]), CNOT) # hide
fig = Figure(size=(400,400)) # hide
_, _, plt, obs = registernetplot_axis(fig[1,1],network) # hide
QuantumSavory.showmetadata(fig,ax,plt,1,1)
fig
```

And here with some extra tag metadata.

```@example vis
tag!(net[2,3], :specialplace, 1, 2)
tag!(net[2,3], :otherdata, 3, 4)
QuantumSavory.showmetadata(fig,ax,plt,2,3)
fig
```

## The state of locks and various metadata in the network

The [`resourceplot_axis`](@ref) function can be used to draw all locks and resources stored in a meta-graph governing a discrete event simulation. Metadata stored at the vertices is plotted as colored or grayed out dots depending on their state. Metadata stored at the edges is shown as lines.

```@example vis
using Graphs
using ConcurrentSim

sim = Simulation()

# add random metadata to vertices and edges of the network
for v in vertices(net)
    net[v,:bool] = rand(Bool)
    net[v,:resource] = Resource(sim,1)
    rand(Bool) && request(net[v,:resource])
end
for e in edges(net)
    net[e,:edge_bool] = true
    net[e,:another_bool] = rand(Bool)
end

# plot the resources and metadata

fig = Figure(size=(700,400))
resourceplot_axis(fig[1,1],net,
    [:edge_bool,:another_bool], # list of edge metadata to plot
    [:bool,:resource],          # list of vertex metadata
    registercoords=plt[:registercoords] # optionally, reuse register coordinates
)
fig
```

## Updating the plots

 You can call `notify` on the returned plot object to replot the state of the network after a change.

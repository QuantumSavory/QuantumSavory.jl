# A Study of Congestions over a Repeater Chain

!!! info "TODO Unfinished"
    This page is unfinished!

A simple example to study congestion on a chain of quantum repeaters.

!!! info "Low Level Implementation"
    This is a very low-level implementation. You would be better of using already implemented reusable protocols like [`EntanglerProt`](https://qs.quantumsavory.org/dev/API_ProtocolZoo/#QuantumSavory.ProtocolZoo.EntanglerProt). On the other hand, the setup here is a simple way to learn about making discrete event simulations without depending on a lot of extra library functionality and opaque black boxes.

Below we embed a live version of the simulation (hosted at [areweentangledyet.com/congestionchain/](https://areweentangledyet.com/congestionchain/)):

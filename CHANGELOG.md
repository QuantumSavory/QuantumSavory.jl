## v0.5.1-dev

- Simplify one of the switch protocols to avoid dependence on GraphMatching.jl which does not install well on non-linux systems. Do not rely on the default `SimpleSwitchDiscreteProt` for the time being.
- Implement a network control protocol that is connection-oriented, centralized and non-distributed
- Implement protocols: request generator and request tracker for simulation with the above control protocol in an asynchronous way.
- Add `PhysicalGraph` struct for storing network metadata as the simulation evolves.
- New tags: `EntanglementRequest`,`SwapRequest`, `DistributionRequest` and `RequestCompletion`
- Add `classical_delay` and `quantum_delay` as keyword arguments to the `RegisterNet` constructor to set a default global network edge latency.
- `onchange_tag` now permits a protocol to wait for any change to the tag metadata. Implemented thanks to the new `AsymmetricSemaphore`, a resource object that allows multiple processes to wait for an update.

## v0.5.0 - 2024-10-16

- Develop `CutoffProt` to deal with deadlocks in a simulation
- Expand `SwapperProt` with `agelimit` to permit cutoff policies (with `CutoffProt`)
- Tutorial and interactive examples for entanglement distribution on a grid with local-only knowledge
- **(breaking)** `observable` now takes a default value as a kwarg, i.e., you need to make the substitution `observable(regs, obs, 0.0; time)` â†¦ `observable(regs, obs; something=0.0, time)`
- Bump QuantumSymbolics and QuantumOpticsBase compat bound and bump julia compat to 1.10.
- Implement a simple switch protocol.
    - Simplify one of the switch protocols to avoid dependence on GraphMatching.jl which does not install well on non-linux systems. Do not rely on the default `SimpleSwitchDiscreteProt` for the time being.

## v0.4.2 - 2024-08-13

- Incorrect breaking release. It should have been 0.5 (see above).

## v0.4.1 - 2024-06-05

- Significant improvements to the performance of `query`.

## v0.4.0 - 2024-06-03

- Establishing `ProtocolZoo`, `CircuitZoo`, and `StateZoo`
- Establishing `Register`, `RegRef`, and `RegisterNet`
- Establishing the symbolic expression capabilities
- Establishing plotting and visualization capabilities
